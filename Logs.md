Proposal for Rupert’s Alternative Education Programme**

**Project Title: Exploring Liminal Spaces through Virtual Reality**

**Introduction** I propose to develop a Virtual Reality (VR) world that delves into the exploration of liminal spaces, dream worlds, and the mechanics of memory. This project aims to offer first-person immersive experiences akin to video games, where users navigate through various representations of liminalities, blending academic research with artistic production.

**Alignment with Rupert's AEP Ethos**

- **Decentralised Knowledge Exchange**: This VR project will serve as a platform for sharing and generating knowledge across disciplines, inviting participants from diverse backgrounds to contribute their interpretations of liminal spaces. It embodies the essence of decentralised knowledge exchange by allowing users to experience and contribute to the evolving narrative of liminality.
- **Intersectionality**: By incorporating narratives and aesthetics from various cultures and identities, the project will explore liminality in a manner that embraces intersectionality, ensuring a multifaceted exploration of dream worlds and memory mechanics.
- **Process-Oriented R&D**: The development of this VR world will be documented and shared with the Rupert community, highlighting the research and iterative design processes, thus contributing to the programme’s emphasis on process-oriented research and development.

**Project Development Phases** The project will unfold in two main phases over the six-month period:

1. **Research and Thesis Writing (June - July)**: Initial months will focus on interdisciplinary research, synthesising findings into a thesis that lays the conceptual foundation for the VR world.
2. **Development and Expansion (August - November)**: The subsequent months will be dedicated to the VR world's development, aiming for a prototype ready for Rupert’s final show and potential inclusion in virtual game stores.

**Engagement and Contribution** I plan to actively engage with the Rupert community by:

- Participating in and contributing to workshops and seminars, sharing insights from the VR development process.
- Proposing a workshop on VR and liminality, offering participants hands-on experience with VR tools and discussing the role of virtual spaces in artistic expression.

**Final Show and Publication Potential** The culmination of this project will be an immersive VR experience showcased at Rupert’s final show, offering a unique, interactive exploration of the programme’s themes. Additionally, the project’s development process, from conceptualisation to execution, will be documented for potential inclusion in Rupert’s publication, contributing to broader academic and artistic discourse.

**Long-term Vision and Engagement with Rupert’s Community** Beyond the programme, I envision expanding the VR world, exploring new liminal spaces and narratives. I am keen to maintain engagement with Rupert’s alumni network, exploring collaborative opportunities and further contributing to Rupert’s legacy of innovative, interdisciplinary exploration.

**Conclusion** This project not only aligns with Rupert’s ethos of decentralised knowledge exchange, intersectionality, and process-oriented R&D but also represents an opportunity to push the boundaries of academic and artistic exploration in the digital realm. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to and growing with Rupert’s vibrant community.

By highlighting the innovative nature of the VR project and its alignment with Rupert's values, this proposal aims to demonstrate the potential impact and relevance of the project within Rupert’s Alternative Education Programme.

###### Short biography
Alyster is an artist, researcher & engineer currently based in the Hague, the Netherlands, specialising in XR technology & interactive [3D] world building. After getting their Bachelor's degree at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, Alyster has been creating many different art and design pieces as well as teaching arts and technology and doing research in the field of collaborative XR environments.

Alyster's primary interest resides in constructing worlds and environments - in whichever way, be it writing, game design, 3D rendering, art installations or in performances. They have a soft spot for solving puzzles, which is why they often work with [visual] programming based software. What fuels them most is expanding my knowledge, which is why their skillset is always growing into different directions. Some may call that generalism, but it can also be viewed as a branching form of specialism. 

Alyster has a deep interest for psychology and biology, and researches and explores how the human brain responds to certain experiences.

###### Reasons for applying
I really want to work with liminal space and research the psychological effects that it has on people, and why sometimes these spaces call to us in melancholic way. I want to break out of the rules of conventional videogames and create something truly devoid of normal game mechanics, but something that could be viewed as one. Virtual 3D spaces are the closest we have to entering a lucid dreamstate. I am dreaming of dedicating all my time to this, to I have the means to fully focus on it. In my daily life I have too many distractions and too many responsibilities. I would like to make these less focused, and put my full focus on researching, experimenting, creating everything needed to make this into a finished artwork. Since I graduated in 2018, I haven't been able to grab that full dedication to a project as I could during my Bachelor's degree - back then I made a virtual reality experiment on Peer Pressure - I enjoyed it to the fullest, and I am looking forward to do this again with all the years of experience and knowledge I gained.

###### Please provide the name (optional) and short description of the project you will be developing during the Alternative Education Programme

Project Name: I Have Been Here Before?
Project Description: 
First and foremost, this project is a research into liminal spaces and dreamspaces. The outcome will be a visual exploration into 3D first-person digital liminal space with a focus on narrative, which impacts the psyche and induces states of nostalgia. I am keen to discover why and how to trigger or leverage this in a digital environment where one can tailor the setting as they would in a laboratory. I aim to play with one's expectations of both liminal spaces and, inevitably, video game environments, given the common association of these spaces with gaming.

I will utilise Unreal Engine and, potentially, sensors or XR equipment to delve into a genre that could be termed 'dreamcore'. This genre uses liminal space to create environments that feel both real and unreal simultaneously. My research will explore internet culture and the fascination with terms such as 'dreamcore', 'weirdcore', and 'liminal space' that has emerged since the late 2010s.

A quick run through of liminal space:
A brief overview of liminal space reveals it as the 'negative space' of locations. It exists in a state of limbo – seemingly empty, yet containing objects, allowing for interaction and exploration. Liminal space is typically devoid of life or any recent indications of it, marking it as a place of transition. Although not intended to be frightening or unsettling, it often evokes a sense of unease and uncertainty, raising questions about our presence and purpose.

The focus of this exploration is 'dreamcore', a relatively new term that encapsulates the mix of unease and nostalgia experienced in liminal spaces. It suggests a familiar, yet distant, sense of having encountered these spaces before.

Targets:
- A [short] thesis or essay where I record my research and summarise my findings
- Multiple virtual environments that can be traversed through the use of sensors or controllers, on some screen [monitor, projector or VR headset]
- A video or short film that explores these environments and captures the dreamstate

###### What other commitments do you have for the period of the programme?
I have obligations between the 30th of July 2024 and the 11th of August - in this time I am abroad - and I work for an art collective. The latter is part-time and flexible, and most of it can be done remotely. I might need to find other sources of income during the programme depending on what expenses I need to make, and what income I can create.

E.g. full-time or part-time work, studies, other residencies, else

## 17 March
- working on application
- emailed the makers of ' #dreamcore ' - another liminal space game quite similar to mine
- adding collisions, removed portal system, working with real space instead and teleports
- adding footsteps, fixing issue - materials werent assigned in the editor settings https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/search?cat=Footsteps&resultSize=190 #foley
- fixed most problems in stage 1, added some weird chairs, stage 1 is as good as finished, works.
- stage 2 needs fixing on the blueprinting part, but most logic is now in there. 
- #physicsmaterial water does not work for some reason. footsteps just don't show up. No idea where the problem lies.--> this was because the material was still set to 'tiles' in the settings.

## 18 March
- fixed level 1. is finished for now. think about how to make the overlap between levels
- replaced stairs with Unreal generated stairs [!]
- looked up some reading material on liminal space and dreamcore
- fixed materials and uv mappings with the modelng tools
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMGJv23ezrc want to implement #niagra water mechanics.
- DOF settings: ![[Pasted image 20240319024559.png]]

## 19 March
- abolishing the sinking floor mechanism in stage 2, it is too finicky and doesn't have the desired effect. maybe later when i implement a swimming system.
- created stage 3 : an empty level with an arch in it [arch self made as well]
- moved all triggerbox stuff from stage 2 to the level blueprint - however had some issues with the floor_big not showing up, turned around the counter and the istriggered.
- adding waterslides
- tons of crashes on the metal thread plate material ??
- fixed materials of multiple arches
- had to move everything in the level up 100 units because of some really weird thing with the #physicsmaterial : below -120 it simply did not work. no explanations available online.
- fixed things not spawning or spawning
- built all levels, then building whole game
- had to make new google acc because old one is blocked out. super annoying : Ihavebeenherebefore.alyster@gmail.com
- posted on itch

## 20 March
- Geert tested game, gave feedback
- added menu item 'continue' and an 'are you sure you want to quit?'
- added small hint for where you should walk
- new idea: ending of stage 1 should be going into the elevator and then moving 'down'
- turned off all online subsystem plugins so it doesn't ask for firewall. If ever posting on #steam make sure to turn this back on!
- built 1.3.2
- added this temporary system in order to have continue button - change to #savegame system later : ![[Pasted image 20240320154331.png]] set up was done in a persistent level named #menuLVL . Set to always load in #Stage1 #Stage2 #Stage3 
- fixed chair having no collision
- fixed some performance issues with lighting and dynamic shadows, turned them off for the water and floor_big objects
- diminished resolution of all textures in order to get 60fps.
- still a bit choppy, maybe make VCR effect, because it actually looks kinda cool
