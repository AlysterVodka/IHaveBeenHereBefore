## STAGE ONE
You are standing in a space with tiles all over the walls until about halfway up. You have never been here before, yet it feels like you know this place... it is quiet - too quiet. A feeling of dread creeps up on you, yet there is nothing out of the ordinary. You go down the stairs, and around the corner, where a bright light blinds you for a second. A hallway with gaping holes in the sides, beyond them nothing but white light. It is as if you are the only creature in the universe, and this space is the only thing that exists in it. It makes you feel small, and lonely. You move on, pass two more corners and... the same place as before. Are you just running in circles? You quickly go down the stairs and turn the corner, to find the same room. You look back for a moment. It is surreal, you are in it, yet you are looking at it. Which one was first? You pass round, and round, in what seems to be a circle, or is it? You lose track of time. Are you going somewhere? Does it ever end? And just when you are about to give up, a text appears: Stage 1 completed. As it fades, your vision fades...

## STAGE TWO

You are now in an enclosed space that resembles a swimming pool, but it seems to shallow to be used as such.
