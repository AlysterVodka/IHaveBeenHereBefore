#liminalspace #dreamcore
## Goals
- [ ] create liminal spaces
- [ ] make puzzles
- [ ] create a state of mind for the player of nostalgia and a feeling of dread at the same time
- [ ] focus on highly explorative and visually stunning scenes

## Approach
1. establish narrative
2. establish goal
3. establish level outline
4. research liminal spaces, take a research question, make that into a goal

### General Factors needed to keep within theme
space should not have a purpose other than connecting other spaces together
examples: stairways, hallways, doorways, bridges
devoid of life where life would be expected
remembering a place you've never been
### Levels Outline

#### Stage 1 : The Hallway
- based on a real space. original use: communal space, hallway entree
- endless hallway, feeling of non-euclidian geometry and a world beyond
- 
#### Stage 2 : the 90's swimming pool in a dreamlike state
- should feel dreamlike and serene, but so quiet that it feels as if it is not right
- changing small details: the floor, after going any direction outside view of the 'hole' - walls still intact
- after going in floor multiple times, make wall invisible. Ocean of water revealed. Gets very quiet
- can go in every direction but will be brought back to the same space. one direction brings you to another portal into the next level

#### Stage 3 : Laundry room inside basement
- labyrinth, lots of laundry, lots of washing machines. can make them spin

#### Stage 4 : Empty Hotel / Business Centre

#### Stage 5 : Mirrorworld
